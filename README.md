# Shop
I present to you a store built on the ASP.NET Core platform, where I applied the MVC architectural pattern. You can view it at this link *I will add it when I upload it to the hosting/Azure*. To run it on a local server, you will need SQL SMS and Visual Studio.

Features:

- Optional registration to save your data for future orders
