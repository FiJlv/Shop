# Shop
I present to you a store built on the ASP.NET Core platform, where I applied the MVC architectural pattern. You can view it at this link *I will add it when I upload it to the hosting/Azure*. To run it on a local server, you will need SQL SMS and Visual Studio.

Features:
- Responsive template
- Optional registration to save your data for future orders
- Registered users can access a page with their favorite products
- Adding products to the shopping cart and removing them
- Choosing a specific category (Electric/Gasoline cars)
- Administrator panel (login credentials: "admin", "password") to add/edit (name, brief description for selection pages, full description for product pages, price, availability, popularity, category, image upload), and delete products

Full technology stack:
- ASP.NET Core MVC
- MS SQL, Entity Framework, Identity Server
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax
